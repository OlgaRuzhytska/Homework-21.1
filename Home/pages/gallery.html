                    After the nonavian dinosaurs became extinct, mammals became the dominant life forms. 
                    The first felinelike mammal, Proailurus, evolved about 30 million years ago. 
                    It is thought that all true cat species evolved from this small civetlike predator.
                    Over time, cats became more than a form of pest control. 
                    A grave containing the remains of a human and a cat dating to about 9,500 years ago was discovered in southern Cyprus. 
                    Since Cyprus is an island and cats are not native, it is clear that cats were transported there by boat, and the burial suggests that cats were already considered companions.
                    As domestic cats spread around the world along trade routes, the species became well adapted to life with humans.
